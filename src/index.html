        <p>
            I am a web developer currently enrolled in the Engineerign Immersion bootcamp at thinkful. Growing up I knew without a doubt 
            I wanted to be a chef. I had a love for creating new things in the kitchen. When I graduated high school and went to college 
            I fell out of love with cooking. I then began to work at a family company just to make money and get by while I decided what 
            to do next. I have always loved gaming so in my free time thats what I would do. I have always loved figuring out how things 
            worked so I started trying to learn some things on my own to figure out why they worked and how. I never got very far into 
            the self learning but always enjoyed it. When I got laid off late in the year I decided it was time to pursue something I was 
            truly passionate about.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I am not coding I can be found at my computer playing games or hanging out with friends down at the beach.
